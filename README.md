# EcoSnap

A hackathon project by team Cinnamon Chai (Astuti, Zainab, Sujay).

## Background

The planet needs us - every individual action counts. Sustainable habits often fade due to lack of motivation, tracking, and community support. People want to reduce their carbon footprint but struggle to stay engaged. Existing solutions feel isolating and offer no tangible incentives. There’s a need for a gamified, social-driven platform that makes sustainability fun, rewarding, and habit-forming—turning everyday eco-friendly actions into collective impact.

Our idea is a social network app to save the environment, one small action at a time. Share a small thing you do for sustainable living everyday in the form of a picture and share it with friends to build streaks. In that manner, the app tracks your daily environment friendly movement, helping you go carbon neutral in every move you log. It encourages users to log eco-friendly habits, such as using reusable bags, opting for public transport, or reducing plastic waste, and share it with their social network. Sharing photos or videos of these actions to your social network increases a daily streak, keeping users engaged for the long run, setting it up to keep users coming back. Leveraging blockchain-backed rewards, users can redeem points for eco-conscious benefits, creating a tangible impact while staying motivated. By making sustainability fun, interactive, and rewarding, the app turns individual efforts into collective climate action.

## Key Features :
1. Streaks : Sending pictures daily to a social network increases 1-1 streak count. Those streaks are used for consistency, habit formation, and are incentivized by rewards. (eg. 100-day streak gets x number of points, which is added to both users’ leaderboard score)
2. Challenges and Leaderboards : Competitive community challenges help large groups of people work together to achieve a goal (30 people walking 300 km in 30 days), and points gained are displayed on the leaderboard of the social network, increasing competition and motivating users to do better. 
3. Rewards : A blockchain enabled system is used for the rewards. Points from theleaderboard can be cashed in for various tangible tokens/rewards. Direct in-app transfers to charities through rewards is also possible.
4. Progress Tracking : Personal actions can be logged through the photo feature andchallenges to increase leaderboard score; profile upgradation is a key part of progress tracking, keeping the user engaged with animations and interactive UI.
5. Map Feature : through maps, you can find sustainable businesses and volunteer opportunities near you.
